        <p><span>About Animals</span></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span>The cat</span> (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat
          or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the
          only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in
          archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat
          occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a
          house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding
          human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to
          kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small
          prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick
          reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are
          well developed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>The dog </span>was the first species to be domesticated by
          humans. Experts estimate that due to their long association with
          humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals
          and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
          inadequate for other canids
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Hamsters </span>are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the
          subfamily Cricetinae, which contains 19 species classified in seven
          genera. They have become established as popular small pets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Crocodiles </span> (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are
          large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa,
          Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used
          even more loosely to include all extant members of the order
          Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family
          Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae)
          among other extinct taxa.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Cockatiels</span> are native to Australia, favouring the
          Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands. There are many
          different mutations of this bird.
