          Contact with animals and nature during youth is especially important
          in terms of individual psychology. It also nurtures the development of
          a relationship with nature. Feeding, cleaning and socializing with the
          animals teaches children and young people many useful skills. The
          students learn how to care for all living things, solve any problems
          with the animals and take long-term responsibility. Setting animal
          care in a learning context fosters the students' relationship with
          nature and provides opportunities to practice everyday skills and
          improves self-sufficiency. This initiative also promotes
          active-citizenship among students which in turn boosts their
          confidence. Caring for animals creates a safe, home-like environment
          for every student through action-based learning. These aspects are
          especially important for those children and youths who come from an
          unstable home or struggle with forming relationships. Giving animals
          long term care provides students with experiences of success,
          reciprocity and acceptance from the animals as well as other students.
          The Vesala comprehensive school in Helsinki has operated a
          conservatory complete with animals since 1991. It grew little by
          little from an enthusiastic teacherâ€™s initiative to the current size
          of about forty animals and 200 plants. To this day, the conservatory
          centers around the relationship between children and animals. In a
          multicultural school animal care and a conservatory provide universal
          phenomena for study. Students who are not directly involved with the
          program can also benefit from the atmosphere of caring. Furthermore,
          the conservatory provides learning experiences for those students who
          have limited skills in Finnish. In the beginning, the children and
          youths are guided how take responsibility over the care of the
          animals. Working with other people in nurturing the animals promotes
          co-operation and may even prevent social exclusion. By participating,
          students gain agency over their own learning process and a sense of
          community. These five steps help you launch a small-scale zoo in your
          school from getting the animals to using them to support teaching.
          These steps also provide concrete methods to grow the program.
